# Song recomendations Based on Lyrics and Audio Features


Nowadays, recommendation systems are ubiquitous around us and music isn't an exception. Musical tastes are quite complex to assess as they are really diverse and very personal. The aim of this project is to try to classify our own musical preferences that are represented by a playlist of our favorite songs. Practically, we will try to find mathematical criteria to separate our musical tastes following two different methods. On the one hand, a first classification is based on the audio features of the songs and on the other hand, on the lyrics of these songs. Once both classifications are established, it will enable us to compare both methods and see whereas one is more accurate than the other. Finally, the goal will be to try and predict, based on the the best of these classifications, by whom new songs are more likely to be liked.

Code 1 : Audio_features - recomendation based on the audio features 

Code 2 : Lyrics - recomendation based on the lyrics using BERT embeddings and a random forest classifier
